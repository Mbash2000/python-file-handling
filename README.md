📂 File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

📖 Description:
This project demonstrates how to manage files and handle errors gracefully in Python.
It is divided into two main tasks:

File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️ – Reads a file, modifies its content, and writes it into a new file.

Error Handling Lab 🧪 – Asks the user for a filename and handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

🚀 Features:
✅ Reads text from a file
✅ Converts content into uppercase (can be modified to other transformations)
✅ Writes modified content into a new file
✅ Handles errors such as missing files, permission issues, or unexpected problems
✅ Asks the user for a filename and provides friendly error messages
